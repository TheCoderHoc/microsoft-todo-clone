# Microsoft Todo Clone

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been feeling really bored lately and decided to build an exact (maybe not exact) replica of the popular Microsoft Todo application. I will be using React, Redux, and Ant Design for the frontend and Node, Express, and MongoDB for the backend.

## Frameworks And Libraries

1. React
2. React Menu
3. Ant Design
4. React Icons
5. React Router
5. Redux
6. Node
7. Express
8. Mongoose
9. Mongo DB

## Live Version

I will deploy the frontend on Netlify and host the backend on Heroku. I don't have the link for the live version set up yet because I haven't even started building out the project yet but I will be sure to include it here when I build out a good portion of the application.
